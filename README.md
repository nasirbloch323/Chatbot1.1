Create a Chatbot with Python and Machine Learning
To create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning, you need to install some packages. All the packages you need to install to create a chatbot with Machine Learning using the Python programming language are mentioned below:

tensorflow==2.3.1
nltk==3.5
colorama==0.4.3
numpy==1.18.5
scikit_learn==0.23.2
Flask==1.1.2


Data preparation:
The second step of this task to create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning is to prepare the data to train our chatbot. I’ll start this step by importing the necessary libraries and packages:

Tokenization:
Now we need to vectorize the data using the Tokenization method to create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning:

Training a Neural Network
Now the next and most important step in the process of building a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning is to train a neural network. Now, I will train and create a neural network to train our chatbot:

Saving The Neural Network:
We’ve trained the model, but before we go any further in the process of building a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning, let’s save the model so that we can use this neural network in the future as well
